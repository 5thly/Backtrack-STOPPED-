# Backtrack GEN1
Open-source terminal project

# My Goal
My goal and aim is to create a pentest terminal using batch/powershell/python as the main language
this version is still incomplete and have many error to be fix 
you can also help me to updating this terminal as how i want it to be.

# How to install?

you can use 

```Git Clone https://github.com/a-MrX/Backtrack``` on terminal

or you can directly install from github.

you also need to install chocolatey in your powershell

and do : 

```choco install nano -y```

# How to use?

As it was, there are plenty commands like :

```public-ip``` : to get your public ip , your public ip was below "OK" after the commands executed

```ip``` : you can get your ip address ipv4, ipv6 and etc..

```pico``` : basically nano but i like the pico name :)```

```clear``` : basically same like linux terminal to clean the terminal from any previous command

```ls``` : same as the name, to show the directory or files in the specific directory that you set..

# Can I Change the Backtrack Code?

Yes you can! You can update and make your own script/command as your own!

Its an open-source terminal project.
